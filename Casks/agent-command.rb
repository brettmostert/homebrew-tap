  caveats <<~EOS
    Agent Command isn't notarized, so this install cleared macOS's quarantine flag
    for it and added its Claude Code hooks. Run acmd to open it.

    To let scheduled jobs wake the Mac shortly before they run, run
    acmd schedule wake on (it asks for your password once).

    Uninstalling ends running sessions, stops its background service and removes
    the hooks. Upgrades leave sessions running. Claude conversations can still be
    resumed after an uninstall.
